**Project Description:**

This project is a simulator designed to mimic the functionality of a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine) machine that is commonly found locally. The simulator provides a virtual environment for users to interact with and experience typical ATM operations.

**Key Features:**

- Account Management: The simulator allows users to create and manage their accounts, including account creation, balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal functionalities.
- PIN Verification: To ensure account security, the simulator incorporates a PIN (Personal Identification Number) verification process. Users are required to enter their PIN to access their accounts and perform transactions.
- Cash Withdrawal: Users can initiate cash withdrawal transactions by specifying the desired amount. The simulator verifies the account balance and dispenses the requested amount if sufficient funds are available.
- Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balance to view the available funds in their account.
- Deposit: The simulator supports deposit functionality, allowing users to add funds to their accounts. Users can specify the amount they want to deposit, and the simulator updates the account balance accordingly.
- Transaction History: The simulator keeps track of transaction history, providing users with a record of their recent account activities.

**Usage and Benefits:**

- Learning Environment: The simulator serves as a learning tool for individuals who want to understand how ATM machines work and get familiar with typical ATM operations.
- Training Tool: It can be used as a training resource for bank employees or individuals working in the financial industry to practice and enhance their skills in handling ATM transactions.
- Testing and Validation: The simulator can be utilized for testing and validating new ATM features, user interfaces, or software updates before implementing them in real ATM machines.
- Educational Purposes: The simulator can be incorporated into educational programs or courses related to banking, finance, or computer science to provide hands-on experience with ATM systems.

The project offers a convenient and risk-free way to explore ATM functionality, enabling users to practice transactions, understand account management, and gain insights into the workings of an ATM machine.
